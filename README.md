# Hi there, I'm Andre! 👋

## About Me 
Hey everyone! I'm Andre Suarez Schou

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a developer who loves bringing ideas to life through code.

I believe in the power of code to solve real-world problems and I'm always looking for new challenges and technologies to explore.

- 🛠️ My favorite tools are Node.js, React Developer Tools, Next.js, tailwindcss, nerdfonts.
- 💡 I’m currently exploring how to use neovim as my IDE.
- 🤝 I'm open to collaborating on projects which involve API and SDK integrations and use of different CMS such as building/coding webshops/e-commerce sites.
